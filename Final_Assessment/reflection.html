            <h3>• Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?</h3>
                <p>Responsive web design is that the design and development of pages should respond to user behaviour and equipment environment (system platform, screen size, screen orientation, etc.). Whether the user is using a laptop or iPad, our page should be able to switch the resolution automatically, image size and related script functions to adapt to different devices.</p>
            <h3>• How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Media Queries<br>
                       Media Queries allow us to run a series of tests (e.g. whether the user's screen is greater than a certain width or a certain resolution) and apply CSS selectively to style the page appropriately for the user's needs.<br><br> </li>
                    <li>Flexible grids<br>
                        A flexible grid means that you don't need to target every possible device size and build a pixel perfect layout for it. Using a flexible grid, you only need to add in a breakpoint and change the design when the content starts to look bad.<br><br></li>
                    <li>Modern layout technologies<br>
                    Modern layout methods such as Multiple-column layout, Flexbox, and Grid are responsive by default. They all assume that you are trying to create a flexible grid and give you more accessible ways to do so. For example: <br>
                    a) Multicol &nbsp;
                    b) Flexbox &nbsp;
                    c) CSS grid  &nbsp;
                    d) Responsive images  &nbsp;
                    e) Responsive typography  &nbsp;  … </li> 
                </ol>
            <h3>• What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?</h3>
                <p>I learned to use Flexbox, Responsive images, and CSS Grid Layout to build web apps for different devices.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In Flexbox, flex items will shrink and distribute space between the items according to the space in their container. By changing the values for flex-grow and flex-shrink, we can indicate how we want the items to behave.<br><br></li>
                    <li>Responsive Images allow designers to create responsive layouts that serve different image sizes at different resolutions.<br><br></li>
                    <li>In CSS Grid Layout, the one unit allows the distribution of available space across grid tracks.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>• Describe your learning experience in the course</h3>
                 <p>In web222, I have learned the basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It's not difficult to get in touch initially, but after in-depth study, I find that they are so sophisticated. </p>
                 <p>In week 1 and 2, I learned JavaScript basic syntax, built‐in functions, and user-defined functions. I think it’s simple for me.</p>
                <p>In week 3 and 4, I learned JavaScript String, Array and customized objects. It’s a little complicated. I tried my best but couldn’t say I knew it very well.</p>
                <p>In week 5 and 6, I learned how to write HTML Containers / Media Elements and update the DOM with data. I could understand this entry part. </p>
                <p> In week 7 and 8, I learned DOM/JavaScript coding, dynamically adding text heading, populating HTML tables using DOM and generating images using DOM (rather than innerHTML property). It’s more complicated. I could cope with the assignment.</p>
                 <p>In week 9 and 10, I learned about styling elements, page layout and image gallery with CSS. With studying assignment 5, I read some other people’s HTML layout code and CSS code. I found I only knew the surface of web technology. People could present glorious web pages by JS, HTML and CSS. I'm still far from them. Especial for responsive web design, I knew I should “make content like water”. But it’s really really hard for me.</p>
                <p> From week 11 to the end, I learned the introduction to Client-side validation by HTML5 or JS. I’m okay with this part, but not sure I could deal with more requirements and a more complex environment.  </p>
